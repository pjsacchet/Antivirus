Short Term
--------------------------
- Keep track of files being hit by adding to list and printing/returning them
- Have function that returns the rule path dependent on the OS




Long Term
--------------------------
- Biggrep functionality
- Server updates with Yara rules
- GUI 



"Main" Functionality
--------------------------
- Check OS type ---> Syntax can be optimized
- Calls directory search function with proper OS type and root directory name
	- Calls os.walk in user directory, grabs full file path, passes it to yara_sig_check
		- Grabs correct directory dependent on OS type ***Create function for this***
		- Compiles all Yara rules and compares with file being scanned ***Keep list of hit files***
