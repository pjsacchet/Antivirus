Goal 
--------------------------
- Overall goal is to create a more efficient, clean, easy to use antivirus program that is not resource intensive
and does not interfere with the user


Short Term
--------------------------
- Keep track of files being hit by adding to list and printing/returning them ---> COMPLETED
- Have function that returns the rule path dependent on the OS ---> COMPLETED
- Incorporate use of dictionaries for multiple rule files that Yara can compile ---> COMPLETED
- Improve syntax optimization (multiple ifs is ugly)
- Monitor computer resource usage while scanning
- Compile Yara rules beforehand (don't have to do it everytime) ---> COMPLETED
- Write results to file ---> COMPLETED



Long Term
--------------------------
- Biggrep functionality
- Server updates with Yara rules (create server?)
- GUI
- Multi threading/multi process searching



"Main" Functionality
--------------------------
- Check OS type ---> Syntax can be optimized
- Creates a dictionary containing the Yara rule files that are held in the proper directory
- Calls directory search function with proper root directory and dictionary of rule files
    - Compiles Yara rules held within the Yara rule directory
	- Calls os.walk in user directory, grabs full file path, passes it to yara_sig_check
		- Checks for matches and returns the file if there was a match
	- Prints the total number of files scanned, the time taken to scan, the number of malicious files, and a list of said malicious files
