## Description
### In this personal project, I aim to create a mock version of a antivirus program, incorporating a GUI along with Yara signatures in order to successfully "scan" and emulate a real antivirus program. 
## Future Features
### - GUI user can interact with to start scan/choose type of scan for system
### - Creation of personal server with database of Yara files that connects to external server to retrieve updates 
### - Server updates that update Yara rule files as soon as the application is launched 
### - Output important results to text file named "Scan + date/time"
### - Implement mulithread/multiproccess scanning
